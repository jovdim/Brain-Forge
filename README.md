# Brain-Forge
Memory Game

This C++ program is a memory-based game called "Brain Forge." It challenges players to memorize and recall sequences of numbers. The game has a menu with options to start the game, view rules, or exit. During gameplay, the difficulty increases with each level, presenting longer sequences for the player to memorize. The player earns points for correctly recalling sequences, and the game continues until an incorrect entry. After completing each level, the player has the option to play again or exit. The program utilizes basic console output, random number generation, and simple input validation.
